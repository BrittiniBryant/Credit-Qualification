# Credit-Quallification
A small app that tests whether your credit score is high enough for our "Bank" to lend you money for a new car.

This small app was made to demonstrate ability to use decision structures, logical operators, comparison operators and JOptionPane.

To test this yourself, you can download the file and compile it with an IDE that works with Java, or you can compile and run it from the command line.
